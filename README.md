## Meta repo of [lsd/vim](http://github.com/lsd/vim)

#### What?

*Literally just an up to date repository tracking the changes in the repo of the <//github.com/lsd/vim> repo.*  

How many meta repos do we need before the public (free) GitHub repository is no longer decipherable?  

#### Why?

As we go through each layer, we get closer to the deltas and hashes of the current repo being significantly lost  
in translation to the point where the meta repo is no longer decipherable but contains just enough to reconstruct  
the original `lsd/vim` repo back if one is interested in stitching together the `N` meta repos.
